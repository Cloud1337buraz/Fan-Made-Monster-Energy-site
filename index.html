<div class = "desc">
<p class = "p1"> The Hansen Natural Company, which is now known as Monster Beverage Corporation, 
    developed Monster Energy, an energy drink, in April 2002. 
    The market share of Monster Energy in the United States as of 2022 was 30.1%,
    which was second only to Red Bull.
    In North America, the Monster brand was associated with 34 different drinks as of July 2019. 
    These included the company's flagship Monster Energy line, Java Monster, 
    Zero Ultra, Juice, Maxx, Hydro, HydroSport, Extra Strength, Dragon Tea, 
    Muscle, Import, and Rehab.</p>

<p class = "p2">The majority of Monster Energy drinks have about 10 mg of caffeine per ounce (33.81 mg per 100 milliliters), 
    or 160 mg in a 16-ounce can. A warning notice on the box typically advises consumers not to drink more than 48 ounces (or 500 milliliters, in Australia) 
    of alcohol per day. It is not advised for those who are caffeine sensitive or pregnant to consume these drinks. Carbonated water, glucose, sucrose, citric acid, 
    taurine, natural flavors, sodium citrate, caffeine, sorbic acid, benzoic acid, niacinamide, sodium chloride, panax ginseng root extract, L-carnitine, L-tartrate, 
    inositol, guarana seed extract, pyridoxine hydrochloride, sucralose, riboflavin, maltodextrin, and cyanocobalamin are among the constituents.</p>
